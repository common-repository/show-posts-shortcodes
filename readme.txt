Easily show a list of posts and custom types of posts on your website using shortcode. 


== Description ==
"Swift Posts" makes it easy to list content from your website. Just use this shortcode in the content editor, and you'll see a list of your desired posts/custom posts:

`[swiftpost-list]`

**Filter by Category**

To only show posts within a certain category, use the category_id parameter:

`[swiftpost-list post_type="your-post-name" show_cat="false" category_id="your-category-id"]`


**Show as other designs**

You can create a great-looking, different kind of designs with some styling. [Here's how!](https://swatiagarwal.info/post-list-demo/)

**Post per page**
You can use post per page option to limit the numbers.

`[swiftpost-list post_type="your-post-name" posts_per_page="4"]`

**Include Image, Date, Author**
To include an image, date, and author, use the following:

`[swiftpost-list post_type="your-post-name" show_image="true" show_date="true" show_author="false"]`

You can use any image size added by WordPress (thumbnail, medium, medium_large, large) OR any custom image size added by your theme or other plugins.

**Sort the list however you like**
By default the listing will list the newest content first, but you can order by title, menu order, relevance, content type, metadata, and more.
